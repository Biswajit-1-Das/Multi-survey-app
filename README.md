# Multi-Survey Response Collection System

**Internship Project**  
Developed under **WEBEL Infotech**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This is a web-based multi-survey response collection system built using **Flask** (Python).  
It allows users to choose from four different survey forms:

- RPL Survey
- STT Survey
- DTET Survey
- Vocational Survey

Each form submission is stored in its **own CSV file** locally, similar to Google Forms but in an offline-friendly format.

- **Separate Data Files**: Each formâ€™s responses are stored in its own CSV file.
- **Auto Header Generation**: Headers are created dynamically on the first submission.
- **Easy Export**: CSV files can be opened with Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor.
